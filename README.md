# Open PS2 Launcher Theme
A modified/upgraded themes for [OPL](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3).

**12.05.2021:** Updated to v0.2 with some small optimizations<br/>
**07.05.2021:** Uploaded a modified version of KORIUM theme by Berion (can be found in releases)
* I modified some graphics, loader animation, icons and CFG as well as placements and the font
* It is suitable for HD and was tested with OPL 1.1.0
* Oh yes, it is PS2+POPS only with USB - so no HDD, ETH or APPs!

## The UI looks like this
 You can switch between PS2 and PS1 (POPS) games easily.

## And of course, the animation
It has been placed at the baseline with the bottom of the game list.
