# Open PS2 Launcher Themes
Selection of modified/upgraded themes for [OPL](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3).

**07.05.2021:** Uploaded a modified version of KORIUM theme by Berion (can be found in releases)
* I modified some graphics, loader animation, icons and CFG as well as placements and the font
* It is suitable for HD and was tested with OPL 1.1.0
* Oh yes, it is PS2+POPS only!

## The UI looks like this
 You can switch between PS2 and PS1 (POPS) games easily.
